                <div>Catholic Relief Services (CRS) exemplifies the principles of Gaudium et Spes in its approach to development. Rather than simply providing material aid, CRS implements programs that promote integral human development through partnership with local communities. For example, in agricultural projects, CRS not only provides seeds and tools but also training in sustainable farming techniques, assistance with market access, and support for community organization, addressing the economic, social, and organizational dimensions of development.</div>
