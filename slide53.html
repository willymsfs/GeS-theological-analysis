                <div>St. Mary's Parish formed a Social Justice Committee based on the principles of Gaudium et Spes. The committee began by conducting a "signs of the times" analysis of their local community, identifying homelessness and immigrant integration as key challenges. They developed a two-pronged approach: (1) direct service through a parish shelter program and ESL classes, and (2) advocacy work addressing systemic causes through partnerships with other faith communities. The committee regularly provides formation for parishioners on Catholic social teaching, connecting worship with action for justice.</div>
