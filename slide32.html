                <div>Studies consistently show correlations between family stability and positive social outcomes. Children raised in stable families tend to have better educational outcomes, lower rates of delinquency, better mental health, and greater economic mobility. This research supports Gaudium et Spes's emphasis on the family as the foundation of society. For example, a longitudinal study by the Harvard Center on the Developing Child found that supportive family relationships are the single most important factor in developing resilience in children.</div>
